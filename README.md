# Netflix Stock Capstone Project
The purpose of the assignment was to imagine I was a data visualization developer at Yahoo Finance helping the "Netflix Stock Profile" team visualize the Netflix stock data.
## General Information
The assigned purpose of the project was to analyze, prepare, and plot data to help the financial analysts asses the risk of the Netflix stock.
Specifically, I was in charge of creating the following visualizations:
+ The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
+ Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
+ The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
+ A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017 
Then I was responsible for creating a slideshow presentation to present the information to the rest of the Netflix Stock Profile team.
The project was developed for the Netflix Data Capstone Project, part of the Data Analyst Career Path in Codecademy.
